Shütshimi is a randomized shoot'em up about a muscle-bound fish with memory problems defending the seven seas.   Armed with your trusty bullet-morphing shotgun, battle through waves of enemies and collect upgrades as you fight through each of the game's bosses. But there's a catch: you have an incredibly short attention span. Combat and upgrade cycles only last 10 seconds each, so act fast!",
