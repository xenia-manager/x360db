        "full": "Rockford™ and Crystal™, heroes of First Star Software's Boulder Dash®, one of the greatest classic video games, get their bits and bytes together to make their Next Gen-Debut. Back in the 80’s, when hairstyles were wild and music was electronic, Boulder Dash® won our hearts. The creative and frantic gameplay mix required both our reflexes and brains to avoid murderous rock slides of Boulders and get our hands on those precious Diamonds in those original 20 fun-filled Caves infested by Fireflies, Butterflies and Amoebas. Now, our childhood heroes appear for the first time on Xbox 360 in Boulder Dash® - XL™! Leaving the essence of what we all love about Rockford’s classic quest for Diamonds intact, this all new Next Gen-Style Boulder Dash® includes 5 exciting Game Modes (over 150 caves), 4 beautiful worlds, new Gameplay Elements, Monsters and more Diamonds to snatch than ever before! ",
        "short": "Boulder Dash®-XL™ is an addictive revival of a true Video Game Classic, now for the first time on Xbox 360. The full game is loaded with awesome classic and modern features: 5 exciting game modes: Arcade, Retro, Score-Attack, Puzzle and Zen. "
