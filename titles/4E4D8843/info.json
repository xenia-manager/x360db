The collection of exercises found in this game were all supervised and approved by the renowned Dr. Kawashima, and require simple movements so that everyone can participate!  In this demo, you'll be working your body and mind to play through an exercise and determine your brain's age! Up to 4 players can take turns to see who gets the best results!",
