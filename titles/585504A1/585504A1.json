His dad likes to play video games.  Alexander wants to play, too! He's too young to shoot aliens, so dad made a game just for him. He likes the flashing colors and fun sounds, but dad says he's learning how to play video games. He even learned to change the color of the whole screen! If you're not old enough for dodging space rocks, try this game.",
