        "full": "Telltale Games put the concept of episodic gaming to the test with Sam & Max Season  One, six episodes that released approximately once a month on PC between October 2006  and April 2007. The full season came to Xbox 360 in 2009 with the name Sam & Max Save  the World. In 2018, when Telltale went through liquidation, four of the studio’s original  employees formed Skunkape Games and acquired the rights to Telltale’s Sam & Max  games. We’re in the process of remastering all three seasons, but we didn’t want the  originals to be lost to time. Want to know what playing these episodes was like on Xbox in  2009? Here they are, in their original form!",
