        "full": "Mayhem is a fast paced arcade racing and car destruction game. It can be played in full 3D on any television.   The inspiration for the game comes from two distinct types of events: Demolition Derby and Banger Racing.  A demolition derby is more of an American pastime, primarily at state fairs and the like. Participants take an old beat down car, strip it of all the glass and other \"dangerous\" elements, spray paint the car and decorate it to their liking, then beat it to death at the main event. The last vehicle standing is the victor.  A Banger Race is more practiced in the UK. Races take place on small courses with pits and hills, and drivers are encouraged to send their opponents off course. Courses can have hazards and obstacles, and the \"figure 8\" shaped course is a staple of the race. ",
        "short": "In Mayhem, players work toward becoming the top driver in both demolition derby and banger race events through a single-player career mode that includes all game modes, multiple vehicles, and up to twelve opponents in 3D exciting and heart-stopping racing action."
