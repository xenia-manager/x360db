        "full": "NBA Baller Beats is the first ever motion-based sports video game where you use a REAL ball to develop REAL skills.  Bounce to the beat across an electrifying soundtrack from hip-hop to rock to old school favorites.  The music is your guide as you aspire to perform like a pro and practice your ball-handling skills while building stamina you’ll need for the court – all while having fun playing a video game.  A basketball is required to play this game.  You can use any size basketball or another ball (for example a pool ball) as long as it is the general size and shape of a basketball and not black in color.  See www.NBABallerBeats.com/ball for more information on game-compatible basketballs.  Game works on most surfaces including carpet. NBA Baller Beats is now available.  ",
