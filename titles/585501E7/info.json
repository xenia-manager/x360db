Xeno Arena is an intense top down shooter where the only goal is to see how far you can delve into the 'facility' before you succumb to the relentless horde of the Xenos.  The further you go, the more Xenos you will have to face.  Each level is randomly generated and, combined with a 'fog of war' system, that means you never know what's lurking around the next corner.",
